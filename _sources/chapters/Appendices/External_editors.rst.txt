External editors
*******************

In order to write a program, you can use the internal text editor provided by AgvManager and RDE. You can use also external editors, the one you like. RDE support 3 external editors, this mean that in the configuration window, you can choose to open the source code in an external editor. Notepad++, UltraEdit and ConTEXT are supported by RDE.

In the following section we will see how we make configuration files in order to highlight the syntax of Xscript, R3 language and object blocks.
