RAT
================

RAT is a CAD software, fig.\ref{fig:refRat}, aimed to design maps and convert them into a formatted ASCII file with \textit{.map} extension. RAT save the created files as ``xml file``. A map can also be created using a text editor following some rules.

RAT can load ``dxf`` files as background, that can be used as a guide to design the desired map. Mainly RAT have lines, points, vehicles. These component will be explained later.

In the properties of the project some settings have to be changed in order to change the behavior of the AGV motion, for example ``Trasversal navigation`` is set by default to ``disabled``. When it is enabled the AGV can move trasversally to a line, and options will be added to points. If some point's options are not visible, check if this property is not set to ``enabled``.
